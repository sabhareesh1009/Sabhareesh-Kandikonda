//Following is the algorithm for this
/*Let us calculate initial value of i*arr[i] with no rotation
R0 = 0*arr[0] + 1*arr[1] +...+ (n-1)*arr[n-1]

After 1 rotation arr[n-1], becomes first element of array,
arr[0] becomes second element, arr[1] becomes third element
and so on.
R1 = 0*arr[n-1] + 1*arr[0] +...+ (n-1)*arr[n-2]

R1 - R0 = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[n-2] - (n-1)*arr[n-1]

After 2 rotations arr[n-2], becomes first element of array,
arr[n-1] becomes second element, arr[0] becomes third element
and so on.
R2 = 0*arr[n-2] + 1*arr[n-1] +...+ (n-1)*arr[n-3]

R2 - R1 = arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[n-3] - (n-1)*arr[n-2] + arr[n-1]

If we take a closer look at above values, we can observe
below pattern

Rj - Rj-1 = arrSum - n * arr[n-j]

Where arrSum is sum of all array elements, i.e.,

arrSum = âˆ‘ arr[i]
        0<=i<=n-1 */
